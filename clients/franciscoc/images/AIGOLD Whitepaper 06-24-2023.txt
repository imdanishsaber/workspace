AIG TOKEN DESCRIPTION

AIGOLD (AIG) is an innovative token that serves as the ultimate hedge against inflation, a world crisis, and looming bear markets.  The AIGOLD (AIG) Token is part of an ecosystem which supports and funds a gold recovery project located off the coast of Alaska in the Bering Sea.  
The gold recovery project allows qualified AIG token holders to receive an annual bonus paid in PAXG.

In addition to sharing in the Bonus from the Gold Recovery Project, AIG token holders also receive a share of a staggering 10% total tax Reward in PAXG, a digital stablecoin backed by physical gold.  This feature ensures that AIG holders have the benefit of owning a digital asset tied to physical gold.  

The World is facing the threat of hyperinflation, de-dollarization and destabilization. Banks are once again failing at an alarming rate, similar to 2008, while many big firms are filing for bankruptcy.   With failing economies again on the rise, many countries such as the BRICS Nations, (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) are stockpiling gold in record amounts and more are joining with Turkey and the UAE being the latest.  These countries are going to great lengths making it clearer that a world currency, backed by gold, is being created.

Given the current state of the world, start stockpiling YOUR gold reserve today with AIGOLD (AIG) and “Hold for Gold”!

AIGOLD (AIG) RECOVERY PROJECT

Gold is once again shining as a stable alternative to fiat and bear markets.   The Gold Recovery project involves the exploration and extraction of gold from the ocean floor of the Bering Sea, one of the world’s richest deposits of gold.

Gold mining in the Bering Sea dates back to the late 19th century during the Alaskan Gold Rush and is a location known to contain significant amounts of gold. Although an estimated six million ounces ($12 BILLION dollars!) have been extracted from the Bering Sea over the last 100 years, it is estimated by some that more than 200 million ounces of gold still remain in the Bering Sea.

The Gold Recovery Project will use an AI integrated Exploration Recovery Vessel (ERV) with state-of-the-art equipment to locate and extract gold from the Bering Sea.  With this project, qualified AIGOLD (AIG) holders will share in the profits, annually, in the form of PAXG, a digital stablecoin backed by physical gold.

As the project yields more gold, the token holders will benefit proportionally in the financial profits resulting from the successful extraction and sale of gold from the Bering Sea.  This annual bonus of gold not only serves as a hedge against global inflation, currency collapse and bear markets; but also serves to further increase the value of the AIGOLD (AIG) token and provide an additional incentive for investors to hold AIG.  As the global economy moves toward gold-backed currencies and gold assets soar, AIG holders are perfectly positioned to reap the rewards of soaring gold prices.

Frequently Asked Questions


1.  What is the AIGOLD (AIG) Token?
AIGOLD (AIG) is an innovative token that serves as the ultimate hedge against inflation, a world crisis, and looming bear markets.  The AIGOLD (AIG) Token is part of an ecosystem which supports a gold recovery project located in the Bering Sea.  

2.  How do you earn gold by holding the AIG Token?
As an AIG token holder, you can earn gold in the following ways: (1) Rewards in PAXG for buy/sell tax, (2) Bonus from a gold recovery project and (3) the ever-increasing value of gold. Both rewards and bonus are paid in a digital GOLD asset, PAXG.  Each PAXG token is backed by one fine troy ounce of gold, stored in LBMA vaults in London. Analyst predict the price of gold will skyrocket to a staggering $8900 per ounce by the year 2030!!  Some say this could happen even sooner if hyperinflation sets in and de-dollarization becomes a reality.  

3.  Why is AIG a great investment?
Our generous 10 percent buy/sell tax reward in PAXG (digital gold asset) coupled with an annual 25% gold recovery bonus makes the AIGOLD (AIG) token a great investment

4.  Is there any Vesting for the AIG Token?
No. All AIG Tokens will be available to claim once the presale has ended just before launch.

5.  Why choose the Bering Sea area for gold recovery?
Gold mining in the Bering Sea dates back to the late 19th century during the Alaskan Gold Rush and is known as one of the world’s richest deposits of gold. Although an estimated six million ounces have been extracted from the Bering Sea over the last 100 years, it is estimated by some that more than 200 million ounces of gold still remain in the Bering Sea.	


6.  How do I buy AIGOLD?
Simply go to the AIGOLD website, connect your wallet to the presale widget, use either ETH or USDT and select the number of tokens you wish to purchase.


7.  Why use AI in a gold recovery operation?

*AI-powered algorithms analyze historical data on underwater currents to identify areas where gold particles may accumulate due to hydrodynamic processes.

*Machine learning models analyze data from underwater pressure sensors to identify areas with higher sedimentation rates, indicating potential gold deposition.

*AI can analyze historical data on the composition of surrounding geological formations to identify areas with a higher likelihood of hosting gold deposits.

*Deep learning algorithms analyze data from underwater LIDAR systems to create high-resolution maps of the sea floor, aiding in gold deposit identification.

These examples showcase the versatility of AI in enhancing various aspects of AIGolds recovery operations in the Bering Sea. 


8.  What is PAXG and why do we use it as a buy/sell tax reward?
     Pax Gold (PAXG) is an asset-backed token where one token represents one fine troy ounce of a gold bar, stored in professional vaults in London.  Since PAXG represents physical gold, its value is tied directly to the market value of gold.  At any time, PAXG holders can look up the serial number, value and physical characteristics of their vaulted gold just by entering their Ethereum wallet address on the PAXG lookup tool. AIGOLD rewards its’ holders with PAXG as an extra layer of protection from inflation while profiting from the ever-increasing value of gold.
